160 Factors and Factorials

The factorial of a number N (written N!) is defined as the product of all the integers from 1 to N. It
is often defined recursively as follows:
1! = 1
N! = N ∗ (N − 1)!
Factorials grow very rapidly — 5! = 120, 10! = 3, 628, 800. One way of specifying such large numbers
is by specifying the number of times each prime number occurs in it, thus 825 could be specified as (0
1 2 0 1) meaning no twos, 1 three, 2 fives, no sevens and 1 eleven.
Write a program that will read in a number N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100) and write out its factorial in terms
of the numbers of the primes it contains.

Input
Input will consist of a series of lines, each line containing a single integer N. The file will be terminated
by a line consisting of a single ‘0’.

Output
Output will consist of a series of blocks of lines, one block for each line of the input. Each block will
start with the number N, right justified in a field of width 3, and the characters ‘!’, space, and ‘=’. This
will be followed by a list of the number of times each prime number occurs in N!.
These should be right justified in fields of width 3 and each line (except the last of a block, which
may be shorter) should contain fifteen numbers. Any lines after the first should be indented.
Follow the layout of the example shown below exactly.
