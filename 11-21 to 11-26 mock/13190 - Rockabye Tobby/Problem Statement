13190 Rockabye Tobby

“Rockabye baby, don’t you cry”.
Tobby is very good at catching the ball, he loves that game so much, that one day he decided to
go out and play, even though it was raining. He played for a long time and in addition to catching the
ball many times, he also got a cold, poor Tobby. That is why now his mother will take care of him,
Big doggie momma, singing that beautiful lullaby (rockabye) and giving him the medications in the
moments that must be taken.
In the medical prescription sent by the doctor, he specifies the name of the medications and how
often they should be taken. The doctor told him that if he takes the medications constantly, he will
be relieved after taking k medicines. Tobby does not like being sick (in fact no one likes to be), so he
promises his mother to be constant with the drugs, that is why he now wants to know what are the
first k drugs that he has to take to feel better. Can you help him?

Input
Input begins with a line containing an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 5), the number of test cases.
For each test case, the medical prescription is written as follows:
Each test case begins with a line containing two integers, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3∗103
) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 104
),
indicating the number of medications sent by the doctor and the minimum number of medicines Tobby
must take to feel better.
The following n lines will be of the form, ‘name frecuency’ (1 ≤ |name| ≤ 15, 1 ≤ frecuency ≤
3∗103
), indicating the name of the medication and how often it should be taken.
The medicines are listed according to their degree of priority, i.e. the first one will be the most
important drug and the last one, the least important.

Output
For each test case, the output must have k lines, each of the form, ‘t m’, indicating that in the moment
t Tobby must take the drug m.
If there are two or more drugs that must be given at the same time t, they should be printed
according to their priority.
