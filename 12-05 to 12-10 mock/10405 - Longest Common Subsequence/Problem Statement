10405 Longest Common Subsequence

Given two sequences of characters, print the length of the longest common subsequence of both sequences.
Sequence 1:
Sequence 2:
For example, the longest common subsequence of the following two sequences ‘abcdgh’ ans ‘aedfhr’
is ‘adh’ of length 3.

Input
Input consists of pairs of lines. The first line of a pair contains the first string and the second line
contains the second string. Each string is on a separate line and consists of at most 1,000 characters

Output
For each subsequent pair of input lines, output a line containing one integer number which satisfies the
criteria stated above.
