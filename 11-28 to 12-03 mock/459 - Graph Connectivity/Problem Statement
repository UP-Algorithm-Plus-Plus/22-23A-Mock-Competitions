459 Graph Connectivity

Consider a graph G formed from a large number of nodes connected by edges.
G is said to be connected if a path can be found in 0 or more steps between any
pair of nodes in G. For example, the graph below is not connected because
there is no path from A to C.
This graph contains, however, a number of subgraphs that are connected,
one for each of the following sets of nodes: {A}, {B}, {C}, {D}, {E}, {A,B},
{B,D}, {C,E}, {A,B,D}
A connected subgraph is maximal if there are no nodes and edges in the
original graph that could be added to the subgraph and still leave it connected.
There are two maximal connected subgraphs above, one associated with the
nodes {A, B, D} and the other with the nodes {C, E}.
Write a program to determine the number of maximal connected subgraphs of a given graph.

Input
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.
The first line of each input set contains a single uppercase alphabetic character. This character
represents the largest node name in the graph. Each successive line contains a pair of uppercase
alphabetic characters denoting an edge in the graph.
The sample input section contains a possible input set for the graph pictured above.
Input is terminated by a blank line.

Output
For each test case, write in the output the number of maximal connected subgraphs. The outputs of
two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
