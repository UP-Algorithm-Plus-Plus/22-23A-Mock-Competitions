10019 Funny Encryption Method

A student from ITESM Campus Monterrey plays with a new encryption method for numbers. These
method consist of the following steps:
Steps : Example
1. Read the number N to encrypt : M = 265
2. Interpret N as a decimal number : X1 = 265 (decimal)
3. Convert the decimal interpretation of N to its binary representation : X1 = 100001001 (binary)
4. Let b1 be equal to the number of 1’s in this binary representation : b1 = 3
5. Interpret N as a Hexadecimal number : X2 = 265 (hexadecimal)
6. Convert the hexadecimal interpretation of N to its binary representation : X2 = 1001100101
7. Let b2 be equal to the number of 1’s in the last binary representation : b2 = 5
8. The encryption is the result of M xor (b1 ∗ b2) : 265 xor (3*5) = 262
This student failed Computational Organization, thats why this student asked the judges of ITESM
Campus Monterrey internal ACM programming Contest to ask for the numbers of 1’s bits of this two
representations so that he can continue playing.
You have to write a program that read a Number and give as output the number b1 and b2

Input
The first line will contain a number N which is the number of cases that you have to process. Each
of the following N Lines (0 < N ≤ 1000) will contain the number M (0 < M ≤ 9999, in decimal
representation) which is the number the student wants to encrypt.

Output
You will have to output N lines, each containing the number b1 and b2 in that order, separated by one
space corresponding to that lines number to crypt
