13095 Tobby and Query

In his free time Tobby is always searching for interesting things. This time Tobby created the following
problem: given a sequence of n integer numbers, Tobby would like to know how many different numbers
are in the range [l, r] (r ≥ l).

Input
The input has several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105
),
the size of the sequence of numbers. The next line contains n values ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 9), the numbers in
the sequence. The next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 104
), the amount of queries. Then there are
q lines, each line contains a query: two integers l and r (1 ≤ l, r ≤ n).

Output
For each test case print q integers, representing the amount of different numbers in the range [l, r] for
each query in the input.
