10334 Ray Through Glasses

Suppose we put two panes of glass back-to-back. How many ways an are there for light rays to pass
through or be reflected after changing direction n times? Following figure shows the situations when
the value of n is 0, 1 and 2.

Input
It is a set of lines with an integer n where 0 ≤ n ≤ 1000 in each of them.

Output
For every one of these integers a line containing an as described above.
