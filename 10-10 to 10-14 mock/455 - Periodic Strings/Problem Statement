455 Periodic Strings

A character string is said to have period k if it can be formed by concatenating one or more repetitions
of another string of length k. For example, the string ”abcabcabcabc” has period 3, since it is formed
by 4 repetitions of the string ”abc”. It also has periods 6 (two repetitions of ”abcabc”) and 12 (one
repetition of ”abcabcabcabc”).
Write a program to read a character string and determine its smallest period.

Input
The first line oif the input file will contain a single integer N indicating how many test case that your
program will test followed by a blank line. Each test case will contain a single character string of up to
80 non-blank characters. Two consecutive input will separated by a blank line.

Output
An integer denoting the smallest period of the input string for each input. Two consecutive output are
separated by a blank line.
