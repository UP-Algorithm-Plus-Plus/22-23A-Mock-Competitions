10583 Ubiquitous Religions

There are so many different religions in the world today that
it is difficult to keep track of them all. You are interested
in finding out how many different religions students in your
university believe in.
You know that there are n students in your university
(0 < n ≤ 50000). It is infeasible for you to ask every student
their religious beliefs. Furthermore, many students are not
comfortable expressing their beliefs. One way to avoid these
problems is to ask m (0 ≤ m ≤ n(n−1)/2) pairs of students
and ask them whether they believe in the same religion (e.g.
they may know if they both attend the same church). From
this data, you may not know what each person believes in,
but you can get an idea of the upper bound of how many
different religions can be possibly represented on campus.
You may assume that each student subscribes to at most
one religion.

Input
The input consists of a number of cases. Each case starts
with a line specifying the integers n and m. The next m
lines each consists of two integers i and j, specifying that students i and j believe in the same religion.
The students are numbered 1 to n. The end of input is specified by a line in which n = m = 0.

Output
For each test case, print on a single line the case number (starting with 1) followed by the maximum
number of different religions that the students in the university believe in.
