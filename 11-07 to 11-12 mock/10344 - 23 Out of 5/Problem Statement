10344 23 Out of 5

Your task is to write a program that can decide whether you can find an arithmetic expression consisting
of five given numbers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ 5) that will yield the value 23.
For this problem we will only consider arithmetic expressions of the following from:
(((aπ(1) o1 aπ(2)) o2 aπ(3)) o3 aπ(4)) o4 aπ(5)
where π : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} → {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is a bijective function and oi ∈ {+, −, ∗}(1 ≤ i ≤ 4)

Input
The Input consists of 5-Tupels of positive Integers, each between 1 and 50.
Input is terminated by a line containing five zero’s. This line should not be processed. Input file
will have no more than 25 lines.

Output
For each 5-Tupel print ‘Possible’ (without quotes) if their exists an arithmetic expression (as described
above) that yields 23. Otherwise print ‘Impossible’.
