11310 Delivery Debacle

Wolfgang Puck has two very peculiar habits:
• I. He only makes two shapes of cakes. One is square and has an area of one unit. The other is
L-shaped and has an area of three units.
• II. He will only deliver cakes packed in very specific box sizes. The boxes are always 2 units wide
and are of varying length.
One day Wolfgang wondered in how many different ways he can pack his cakes into certain sized
boxes. Can you help him?
The precise sizes of the cakes Wolfgang makes and one way to pack them in a box of length 6.
