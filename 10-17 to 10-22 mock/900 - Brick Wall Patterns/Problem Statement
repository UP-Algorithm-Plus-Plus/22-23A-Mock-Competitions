900 Brick Wall Patterns

If we want to build a brick wall out of the usual size of
brick which has a length twice as long as its height, and if
our wall is to be two units tall, we can make our wall in
a number of patterns, depending on how long we want it.
From the figure one observe that:
• There is just one wall pattern which is 1 unit wide —
made by putting the brick on its end.
• There are 2 patterns for a wall of length 2: two sideways bricks laid on top of each other and two bricks
long-ways up put next to each other.
• There are three patterns for walls of length 3.
How many patterns can you find for a wall of length 4? And, for a wall of length 5?
Your task is to write a program that given the length of a wall, determines how many patterns there
may be for a wall of that length.

Input
Your program receives a sequence of positive integers, one per line, each representing the length of a
wall. The maximum value for the wall is length 50. The input terminates with a ‘0’.

Output
For each wall length given in the input, your program must output the corresponding number of different
patterns for such a wall in a separate line.
