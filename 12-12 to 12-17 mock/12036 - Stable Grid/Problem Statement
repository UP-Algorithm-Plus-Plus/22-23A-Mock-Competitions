12036 Stable Grid

Consider a grid of size n x n where each cell contains a number. Let’s call a grid stable if we can
rearrange the numbers of each row so that every column of the resulting grid has no repeated values.
Mathematically, say, we have a grid G of size n × n. We would like to permute the elements of each
row Gi (1 ≤ i ≤ n) so that the resulting grid has the following property:
For every column j, the values Gi,j are all distinct for (1 ≤ i ≤ n).
As an example, consider a grid G of size 4 × 4 as shown below
2 1 1 3
3 1 2 6
2 6 10 3
9 8 7 6
We can permute each row to get G′ as shown below
2 1 1 3
1 3 6 2
6 2 3 10
9 8 7 6
In G′, there are no repeated values in any column. So, the given grid is stable.
In this problem, you will be given a grid of size n×n and you have to determine whether it is stable
or not.

Input
Input starts with an integer T (≤ 500), denoting the number of test cases.
Each case starts with a line containing the value of n (0 < n < 100). The next n lines contain n
integers each. The j-th integer of the i-th line represent the value of Gi,j . Consecutive integers in each
line are separated with space characters. All the integers in the grid are non-negative with magnitude
not greater than 100.

Output
For each case, output the case number first. If the given grid is stable, output ‘yes’ otherwise output
‘no’. Look at the samples for exact format.
