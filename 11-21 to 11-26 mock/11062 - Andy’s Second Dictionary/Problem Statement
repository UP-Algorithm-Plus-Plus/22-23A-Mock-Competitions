11062 Andy’s Second Dictionary

Andy is now 9-year old and is getting ambitious. He wants to become the world largest dictionary
editor. You have already helped him to solve a problem with a computer and he now turns back to
you with a new challenge. He already has a program that copies all the words from a text and outputs
them in alphabetical order. Unfortunately, this program does not take into account hyphenation and is
not satisfying him. He wants you to write a new program that can copy words from a text, even when
those words are hyphenated.
The input file is a text with no more than 500 words of arbitrary length. Input is terminated by
EOF.
You are asked to write a program that lists all the different words in the input text. In this
problem, a word is defined as a consecutive sequence of alphabets, in upper and/or lower case. Words
with only one letter are also to be considered. Furthermore, your program must be CaSe InSeNsItIvE.
For example, words like “Apple”, “apple” or “APPLE” must be considered the same. Also words may
be hyphenated. When a word is hyphenated, its prefix initiates on a line, followed by hyphen character,
maybe followed by a newline, followed by the rest of the word. The rest of the word may be itself
hyphenated. The hyphen character is part of the word if, and only if, not followed by a newline.

Input
The input file is a text terminated by EOF.

Output
Your output should give a list of different words that appears in the input text, one in a line. The
words should all be in lower case, sorted in alphabetical order.
Note: This problem is an evolution of Andy’s first dictionary, problem number 10815.
