10260 Soundex

Soundex coding groups together words that appear to sound alike based on their spelling. For example,
“can” and “khawn”, “con” and “gone” would be equivalent under Soundex coding.
Soundex coding involves translating each word into a series of digits in which each digit represents
a letter:
1 represents B, F, P, or V
2 represents C, G, J, K, Q, S, X, or Z
3 represents D or T
4 represents L
5 represents M or N
6 represents R
The letters A, E, I, O, U, H, W, and Y are not represented in Soundex coding, and repeated letters
with the same code digit are represented by a single instance of that digit. Words with the same
Soundex coding are considered equivalent.

Input
Each line of input contains a single word, all upper case, less than 20 letters long.

Output
For each line of input, produce a line of output giving the Soundex code.
