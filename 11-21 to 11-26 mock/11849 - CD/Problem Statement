11849 CD

Jack and Jill have decided to sell some
of their Compact Discs, while they still
have some value. They have decided to
sell one of each of the CD titles that they
both own. How many CDs can Jack and
Jill sell?
Neither Jack nor Jill owns more than
one copy of each CD.

Input
The input consists of a sequence of test
cases. The first line of each test case contains two non-negative integers N and M,
each at most one million, specifying the
number of CDs owned by Jack and by
Jill, respectively. This line is followed by N lines listing the catalog numbers of the CDs owned by Jack
in increasing order, and M more lines listing the catalog numbers of the CDs owned by Jill in increasing
order. Each catalog number is a positive integer no greater than one billion. The input is terminated
by a line containing two zeros. This last line is not a test case and should not be processed.

Output
For each test case, output a line containing one integer, the number of CDs that Jack and Jill both
own.
