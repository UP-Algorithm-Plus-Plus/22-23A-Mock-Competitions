991 Safe Salutations

As any minimally superstitious person knows all too well, terrible things will happen when four persons
do a crossed handshake.
You, an intrepid computer scientist, are given the task of easing the burden of these people by
providing them with the feasible set of handshakes that include everyone in the group while avoiding
any such crossings. The following figure illustrates the case for 3 pairs of persons:

Input
The input to this problem contains several datasets separated by a blank line. Each dataset is simply

Output
The output is equally simple. For each dataset, print a single integer indicating the number of possible
crossless ha
