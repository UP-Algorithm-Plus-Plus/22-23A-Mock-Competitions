11332 Summing Digits

For a positive integer n, let f(n) denote the sum
of the digits of n when represented in base 10.
It is easy to see that the sequence of numbers
n, f(n), f(f(n)), f(f(f(n))), . . . eventually becomes a
single digit number that repeats forever. Let this single digit be denoted g(n).
For example, consider n = 1234567892. Then:
f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 2 = 47
f(f(n)) = 4 + 7 = 11
f(f(f(n))) = 1 + 1 = 2
Therefore, g(1234567892) = 2.

Input
Each line of input contains a single positive integer n
at most 2,000,000,000. Input is terminated by n = 0
which should not be processed.

Output
For each such integer, you are to output a single line
containing g(n).
