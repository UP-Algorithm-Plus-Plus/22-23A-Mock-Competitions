12626 I Love Pizza

Everybody loves pizza: Margarita, Four cheese,
Salami, Caprichosa, Neapolitan, Hawaiian... The
famous pizza Margarita is named after the Italian
Queen Margarita of Savoy. It is said that the chef
Raffaele Esposito gave her to choose from a variety
of pizzas he had prepared specially for the Queen.
Margarita chose this pizza in honor of the colors of
the Italian flag: red tomato, white cheese, and green
basil.
However, some people argue that, in fact, Queen
Margarita did not like onion, and as all the other
pizzas had onion, she had no choice but that pizza.
In our particular computerized kitchen, ingredients are named by capital letters: ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’,...
Thus, to make a pizza MARGARITA we need as many ingredients as their letters, i.e. one ‘M’,
three ‘A’, two ‘R’, one ‘G’, one ‘I’, and one ‘T’.
For example, if we have the ingredients:
AAAAAAMMRRTITIGGRRRRRRRR
Then we can make 2 pizzas MARGARITA, and still spare some ‘R’.
Given a set of ingredients, you have to say how many pizzas MARGARITA can be made. Note
that there may be leftover ingredients, and also there may be unnecessary ingredients, such as ‘B’.

Input
The first line contains a natural number, N, which indicates the number of test cases.
Each test case is given in one line. This line contains a series of capital letters from ‘A’ to ‘Z’, which
can be messy and may be repeated. At most one line can have 600 characters.

Output
For each test case, you must indicate how many pizzas MARGARITA can be made with the letters
available, taking into account that there may be spare letters.
